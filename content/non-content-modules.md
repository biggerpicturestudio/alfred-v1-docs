Non-content modules are those ones that **are not responsible for content creation**. Perfect example of a non-content module could be the **Forms** module that just stores the form submissions from a website and gives Alfred Users an ability to manage them.

If you need to create a new module and its purpose is something different than content creation, remember to set the **contentModule** setting in `config/cms.php` file to `false`.
