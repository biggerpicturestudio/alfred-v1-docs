If you are novice in using Alfred and front-end code implementation into Alfred system, it is highly recommended to start from reading about the Alfred concept, structure, how the page content is organised, how to implement front-end code in front page's templates, what microcomponents are, how to create sections, headers, how to implement and so on. 

**Please go through all the documentation pages first in order to understand Alfred**.

# How to get started with Alfred
1. Installation of plain Alfred code.
2. Setting up necessary modules (and components if needed).
3. Implementation of Website Theme customisation options.
4. Website navigation (Menu) implementation.
4. Creating headers and sections.
5. Views implementation in all modules.

In case of custom project needs - feel free to do whatever you need. 

Just follow the Alfred's mantra: 
### Keep it simple and friendly for Alfred Users and developers.

And remember about website performance :-)
