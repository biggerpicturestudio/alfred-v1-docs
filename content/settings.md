It is a module in Alfred CMS which is a centre of Alfred Panel-related stuff. You can add new users, manage their privileges, create user groups, manage user accountâ€™s settings. You can find logs, section templates list, management of website languages.

This module should not be edited by you if it is not absolutely needed. Of course, if there is a special need to adjust something - feel free to do it but at the same time make double sure that it does not affect any other functionalities in Alfred.
