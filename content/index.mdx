# What is Alfred?
Alfred is a friendly CMS for users and web developers.

Alfred is the CMS which serves the CMS UI as easy as possible to a customer (Alfred User) with one goal - easy content management to handle custom front page design. Custom design with custom CMS solutions. 

# Concept
Alfred UI and how the content management works can be differently per project - it is not like Wordpress and the „Posts” module where you always add not only blog posts but also pages, product pages and everything, making it totally uneasy to manage in one „Posts” bag.

In Alfred you can easily create separate modules like Blog, Products or whatever you need. In every module you can create sections and fields within those sections, allowing user to just put the right content in the right places without worrying about breaking the front page layout. All well-organised in modules and components not only for users but also for developers.

Alfred UI can look different per each project but under the hood there are constant rules and components or micro components that allow developers to deliver the content management easy for the end users. Possibilities are infinite - you can create a new module, new components, new micro components per project and deliver the best UI for any customer.

# Goal
Please use and develop Alfred as a flexible platform, not like constant, same system forever for every project. The rules how to use Alfred should be constant, not the needed project functionalities!
